.zsh
==========

Personal zsh configuration, heavily sourced from Eevee from [veekun](http://veekun.com).

There is a file that is gitignored: `.zshbashpaths`. This is meant to add personal configuration options for your specific machine, such as aliases and hacks.

### Setup
zsh requires the .zshrc to be available, so create a ~/.zshrc with the lines:
```
source /path/to/this/repo/.zshrc
```
You can also just symlink ~/.zshrc to this .zshrc.
