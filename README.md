.zsh
==========

Personal zsh configuration, heavily sourced from Eevee from [veekun](http://veekun.com).

### Setup
zsh requires the .zshrc to be available, so create a .zshrc file in your home with the lines:
```
source ~/.zsh/.zshrc
source ~/.zsh/.zshenv
```
Change the directory to wherever you cloned the git repo to.

Some items point to ~/.vim or ~/.emacs.d; remove them if not using my other emacs and vim configurations.
